tomaty is a pomodoro app featuring basic stats tracking and notifications with many more features on the way.

.. contents::

why
=====

the primary motivation for yet another pomodoro app was that none of the others I could find were:
  1. native
  2. not an electron app
  3. simple but feature robust (flexible for user preferences)

goals
=====

while tomaty's current release is limited in features, i'm already working hard on another major release. 

the following features should be available in the coming `2.0.0` release:
  1. To-Do list
  2. basic settings page for user configuration
  3. setting: continuous mode
  4. setting: pausing (rather than resetting)
  5. setting: dark theme
  6. ... *and more!*

If you would like to see how things are going, checkout the project page for `tomaty v2 <https://github.com/ejmg/tomaty/projects/2>`_.
